# Space_Rover
Using Gyroscope and Gps to navigate a six-wheel rover through Gps coordinates. programmed using arduino board. 
 I built this code to control a space rover prototype:
    The rover Participated in European Rover Challenge ERC held in Poland, September 2014 and got the 3rd place in ERC.
    My role was to Design and implement the Control system to navigate the rover autonomously.
    
The Modelling and Attitude control segement is published in      
    “Modelling and Control Design of Rover Vehicle Using Classic and Adaptive Control”
